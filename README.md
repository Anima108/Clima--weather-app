## Goal

I implemented asynchronous programming in Dart and how to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet. 


## What I tried to create

I tried to make a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-). By the end,I find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!
